# Employee Leave Management System (EMS) Backend

## Overview
This project is a **Django + Django Rest Framework (DRF) based Employee Management System (EMS)** that manages users, teams, leave allocations, leave requests, and approvals. It implements **role-based access control** and supports features like leave deduction/ restore, withdrawal, and approval history. The system includes REST APIs with JWT authentication and Swagger UI for testing.
